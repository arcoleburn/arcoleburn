### About Me
Shakespearean Actor, turned Management Consultant, turned Software Developer. Quite the combo, I know. 

*Here's the story:* 

I'm a former theatre kid who got halfway through an MFA in Acting before deciding against a life in show business. Since then, I've finished a Masters in Theatre, worked as a consultant in NYC, joined a talent-aquisition firm in Raleigh, NC, and found the time to start teaching myself how to code.

Spending 10 hours a day cold-calling potential job seekers made me realize I wanted to do work that resulted in actually making something. So I enrolled as a student in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion program, to learn how to make kick-ass software.

Currently, I'm working as a Developer and Consultant for Bitovi.

I don't only write software, I write other stuff too. Most of that is over on [Medium.](https://arcoleburn.medium.com/)
